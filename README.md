# PartitionSizeCalculator
A partition size calculator for FAT32 and NTFS when using Windows partitioning tools, such as FDISK and DiskPart.

There are some other similar programs available on the web, and I made a decision to write another such program in Java.

My aim is to make the most lightweight partition size calculator ever.
